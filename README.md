# BG3ModsProfilesManager
A repository made for a simple app built with Python that create and load mods profile based on the current active mods inside the game.
Just download a release version and execute the .exe. You can save a profile with the game running, but to load a profile you need to close it.
(It's part of the game limits, it's not my fault)
